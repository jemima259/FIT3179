            <h2>Why put trees in a city?</h2>
            <p>As climate change heats up the planet, this presents new problems to cities such as urban warming.  Urban warming refers to the phenomenon where urban surfaces are warmed by the sun and as a result, cities are much warmer than the areas around them, forming “urban heat islands.” These result in many negative consequences such as increased energy consumption, elevated air pollution, and compromised human health.  The City of Melbourne’s Urban Forest Strategy aims to mitigate urban warming by improving its urban forest in order to increase the canopy cover in the city, which will shade and cool urban surfaces.  As we can see in this map where each <span class="dark-green">tree</span> is represented by a dot, much of Melbourne already has canopy cover, although there are areas for growth. </p>

            <h2>Are enough on streets?</h2>
            <p>Although trees in parks still help to improve air quality and human wellbeing, trees are required in the <span class="dark-green">streets</span> and among the buildings of cities in order to provide canopy cover for urban surfaces such as roads and rooftops to effectively reduce urban warming.  As pictured to the left, most urban trees are in <span class="light-green">parks</span>, not <span class="dark-green">streets</span>, so perhaps the City of Melbourne's future tree planting efforts need to focus more on <span class="dark-green">streets</span>.  Other benefits on planting trees in <span class="dark-green">streets</span> include reducing stormwater run off, reducing noise, and protecting pedestrains from motorists. </p>

          <h2>What was planted when?</h2>
          <p>In this line graph, we can see that most of the trees that have been planted are in the <span class="dark-green">Myrtaceae</span> family, in Melbourne most of these are Red River Gums (a Eucalypt).  <span class="dark-green">Myrtaceae trees</span> are a great choice of tree for an urban forest because they are evergreen, so they won’t lose their leaves and therefore canopy cover in the winter. However, as many of these trees were planted in 1998, in the next few years they will begin to age and become more susceptible to disease such as Myrtle Rust, which threatens to wipe out the Red River Gums.  Therefore, other tree types should be considered for planting in order to increase biodiversity and reduce the impact of a disease outbreak.</p>

            <h2>How big are the current canopies?</h2>
            <p>Generally, the diameter of a tree's trunk indicates the relative size of the tree's foliage, so the larger a tree's trunk diameter, the more canopy cover it provides and the more it helps to reduce urban warming. The diameter of a tree depends on its stage of life. The “stage of life” classifications are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a “new” tree is one that has been planted in recent months and is still weak</li>
              <li>a “juvenile” tree has been planted in the last few years</li>
              <li>a “semi-mature” tree is a strong tree which has not yet reached its maximum foliage capability</li>
              <li>a <span class="dark-green">“mature”</span> tree has reached its peak</li>
              <li>an <span class="dark-green">“over-mature”</span> tree has stop growing and has started to decay</li>
            </ul> 
            <p> As visualised to the left, <span class="dark-green">mature</span> and <span class="dark-green">over-mature</span> trees tend to be the widest.  We can also see that although the city contains very few <span class="dark-green">over-mature trees</span>, there are plenty of semi-mature trees that will become mature in the coming years and increase the area of canopy cover.</p>
